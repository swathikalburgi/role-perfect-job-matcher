RolePerfect is a smart, intuitive app that helps users discover the top 10 job roles that match their profile â€” either by uploading a resume or selecting a job title.

Powered by NLP and cosine similarity, RolePerfect analyzes job roles and resumes using TF-IDF to deliver instant, personalized job recommendations.

##Dataset Source

This project uses a cleaned version of the [AI Salary Dataset by Ruchi Bhatia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) from Kaggle.

We downsampled and reformatted the dataset to improve responsiveness for app deployment.
